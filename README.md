# Portfolio_TBS

## Description
I created a rough outline of a responive portfolio page to showcase skills and projects to potential future employers. I will add to this as time goes on and more projects and skills are completed/obtained. I attempted to successfully utilize flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables in completing this portfolio page. The page includes an About Me section, a Portfolio section, a Contact section, and a Resume section.

## Final Product

The link to the deployed webpage is here: https://tbsmith0205.github.io/Portfolio_TBS/
